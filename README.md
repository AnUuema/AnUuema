# Hi, I'm An U
I'm 22 years old and from Russia  
Right now I'm learning data science and trying to get better at working with data, models, and everything in between

I used to be into web development, which helped me get started with programming in general and gave me a clear understanding: I definitely don't want to deal with frontend-backend integration ever again ðŸ™‚ðŸ”«

## Things I use and learn

- Faith in God
- Red Bull
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- SQL
- Jupyter notebooks
- A bit of PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Git

Also slowly learning about MLOps, cloud stuff, and how to deploy things that actually work

## About the nickname

An U = Anna Uuema  
Just a mix of my name, nothing fancy :)

Feel free to check out my projects and give some review, I'm still learning

I try to keep things clean and improve step by step
